  /**
   * Allows Flash file references to be attached to models. Requires something
   * like attachment_fu or paperclip on the server-side if you are using
   * remote service provider.
   *  
   * @example For attachment_fu use this:
   *  
   * <listing version="3.0">
   *  var ref:RxFileReference = new RxFileReference;
   * </listing>
   *  
   * @example For paperclip use this:
   *  
   * <listing version="3.0">
   *  var ref:RxFileReference = new RxFileReference("avatar")
   * </listing> 
   *  
   * <p>This will match <code>has_file_attachment :avatar</code> in your Ruby model.</p>
   *  
   * <p>If you pick a different name adjust the argument to constructor accordintly.
